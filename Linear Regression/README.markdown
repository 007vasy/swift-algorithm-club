# Linear Regression
## First draft version of this document

Linear regression is a technique for creating a model of the relationship between two (or more) variable quantities.

For example, let's say we are planning to sell a car. We are not sure how much money to ask for. So we look at recent advertisments for the asking prices of other cars. There are a lot of variables we could look at - for example: make, model, engine size. To simplify our task, we collect data on just the age of the car and the price:

Age (in years)| Price (in Â£)
--------------|-------------
10 | 500
8 | 400
3 | 7,000
3 | 8,500
2 | 11,000
1 | 10,500

Our car is 4 years old. How can we set a price for our car based on the data in this table?
