# Radix Tree

A radix tree (or radix trie, compact prefix tree) is a space-optimized tree used for constructing associative arrays that are usually expressed as strings. Edges in radix trees store strings. If you started at the root of the tree and traversed down to any node that has no children, concatenating the edges in order of traversal would result in a stored word. An example can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree#/media/File:Patricia_trie.svg).
