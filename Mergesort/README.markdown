# Mergesort

Goal: Sort an array from low to high (or high to low)

Invented in 1945, mergesort is a fairly efficient sorting algorithm with a best, worst, and average time complexity of O(n log n). The idea behind Mergesort
is to **divide and conquer**. I'd like to call it **split first** and **merge after**.
